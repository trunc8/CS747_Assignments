# Assignment 1

## Sampling Algorithms & Thompson Sampling Given Hint

### Python3 Dependencies

1. numpy
2. matplotlib

### How to Run

1. Check that you are in the `Assg1/scripts` directory
2. The next two commands take pretty long (> 1 hour). If your system crashes during execution, assign a lower value to `n` in `Tn_multithread.py` [Line 45]. You may skip the next two steps as the `outputDataT1.txt` and `outputDataT2.txt` files are already present in `Assg1/scripts`
3. `python3 Tn_multithread.py -n 1`
4. `python3 Tn_multithread.py -n 2`
5. `python3 verifyOutput.py`
6. `python3 plots.py -n 1`
7. `python3 plots.py -n 2`
